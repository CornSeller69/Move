<h1>Move</h1>
<p>Move is a simple "engine" for HTML, which I made just to simplify my own personal projects, but I don't really care so I just decided to set it public for use.</p>
<p>It makes few things shorter and also introduces simple WASD movement mechanic (which is also where it's name comes from).</p>

>[!TIP]
> [Wiki for the Repository contains all that you need to know about current and/or upcoming functions of the Engine.](https://github.com/CornSeller69/move/wiki)

Current up-to-date version of Move: `v1.0`
